Sunlight scattered by gases with very negligible intensity because according to Rayleigh equation the intensity of light is directly proportional to the sixth power of particle's diameter that cause particles of 40 nanometers diameter (  is approximately equivalent to the sphere diameter ) to be more than trillion times more intense than gases ( nitrogen & oxygen ) and much less intense than haze ( about 200 nanometers ). On the other side tiny particles and haze ( below the wavelength of violet ) appear white in cold weather while storm clouds ( very far away over the wavelength of red ) appear blue sometimes, which means that atmospheric blue color is Rayleigh scattering independent. It is more easy to explain in my mother language as shown in this link that ozone layer reflects ocean's color â€” Preceding unsigned comment added by 41.218.181.44 (talk) 08:48, 18 October 2012 (UTC)
