The "proof" is what I wrote in the motivation of my edit. A beam is much more visible when it is directed toward you than away from you, which is typical of Mie/Tyndall scattering, whereas Rayleigh would be symmetrical: think to a thin sunbeam entering a dark room. In this case, moreover, you can distinguish a lot of dust, whose radius I think improbable to be smaller than λ/2π (about 80 nm), which is the boundary between Rayleigh and Mie (see the first figure in Mie scattering). And, even if the dust were small, the figure would be out of place, in the paragraph "From molecules". Finally, perhaps one should prove that the laser beam represents Rayleigh scattering, to keep the figure, rather than disprove it to remove it. Maybe that changing the figure position could be a reasonable compromise. --87.7.187.76 (talk) 08:50, 18 March 2012 (UTC)
