Coventry has only qualified for European competition once, during the 1970–71 season, when they competed in the European Inter-Cities Fairs Cup, reaching the second round. Despite beating Bayern Munich 2–1 in their home leg, they lost heavily in the away leg to go out of the competition. They were unable to compete in the 1987–88 UEFA Cup Winner's Cup due to the ban on English clubs following the 1985 Heysel Stadium disaster.
