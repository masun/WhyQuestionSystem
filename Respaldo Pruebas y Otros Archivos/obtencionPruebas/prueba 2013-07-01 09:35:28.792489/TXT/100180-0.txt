Seto Kaiba's key signature card. During the Memory World arc, the Blue Eyes White Dragon is revealed to be the Ka of a girl named Kisara. She and Priest Seto (Seto Kaiba's past incarnate) shared a deep bond that appears to have carried over into Kaiba's modern-day obsession with the BEWD. As a monster, versus just a playing card, the power of the Blue Eyes was shown to surpass even that of the Egyptian gods, as it was the first monster who actually injured Zorc Necrophades.
