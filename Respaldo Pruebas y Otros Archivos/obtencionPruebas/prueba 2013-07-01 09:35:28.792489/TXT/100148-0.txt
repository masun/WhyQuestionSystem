To understand why the night sky is black, we first have to understand why the daytime sky is blue. The daytime sky on earth is blue because the light from the Sun strikes molecules in the earth's atmosphere and scatters in all directions. Blue light is scattered more than other colors, and reaches the eye in greater quantities, making the daytime sky look blue. (This is known as Rayleigh scattering.)
