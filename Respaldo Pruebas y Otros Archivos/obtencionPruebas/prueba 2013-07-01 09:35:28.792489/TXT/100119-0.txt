Blue icebergs develop from older, deep glaciers, resulting from tremendous pressure experienced for hundreds of years. The process releases and eliminates air that was originally caught in the ice by falling snow. Icebergs that have been formed from older glaciers, have little internal air or reflective surfaces. When light from the sun hits the iceberg, it is absorbed, rather than reflected. The light leaving the ice returns as blue or blue-green. The sun's emitted light, only allows the blue wavelengths to escape. Icebergs are blue, due to this light refraction. Glaciers reflect as blue, due to the scattering of light, much in the same way that makes the sky blue. Clean air scatters blue light more than wavelengths toward the red. The sky looks blue because of an effect called Rayleigh scattering, which occurs when the sunlight bounces off the molecules in the atmosphere. Rayleigh scattering takes place when light interacts with air molecules.
