Antiquarian nationalist Francis Joseph Bigger considered St. Patrick's blue a "fake colour" and Saint Patrick's Flag a "fake flag".Brian Ó Cuív questioned it.Irish College in Paris, completed in 1776,Thomas Dineley reported people wearing crosses of green ribbon in their hats on Saint Patrick's Day.
